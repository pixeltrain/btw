# Beyond the Void

The second game from our small game studio.

*The game is currently under development.
I can't give an exact release date.
Maybe it will come out in a few years.*

## About the game
In many ways, this game will be similar to our
[first project](https://github.com/pixeltrain/student-quest),
but it will be more thoughtful and interesting.
You will have to plunge into Larry's life and help him carry out daily activities.
Explore the small town he lives in, help him keep a photo blog and remember something important.

## How to help us

1. Please help spread the word about the game as much as possible.

The game is not made for profit. We just want to tell a story
and promote open source in the game development community.

2. Help with translating the game into English.

English is not our native language.
If you find any mistakes - let us know or send a pull request.

3. Music writing

We are looking for a composer. You can contact us by email.
It is unlikely that we will be able to offer you a large reward,
but we are ready to consider different options.

## Localization

You can find `.po` translation files in the i18n directory.
They can be edited using any text editor or special programs such as Poedit.
